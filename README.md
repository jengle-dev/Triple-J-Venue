# Triple-J-Venue
As an event venue owner, I want to have a responsive web application that allows clients and potential customers visibility into our venue's availability for their event needs. 

## Installation
To run this on your localhost:3001/ open a terminal in Visual Studio Code or Git Bash and enter the following prompts:

mysql -u root -p
Enter your password for MySQL:
mysql> source db/schema.sql
quit

npm i
node seeds/index.js
npm start

## Usage
A user will be able to navigate the application to view available venue spaces and upcoming events.
